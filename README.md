# Arabic Text Diacritization

Minimal usage guide for this project.

## How to run

- Train: open `train.ipynb` and run the cells in order to train and save the model checkpoints/weights under `models/`.
- Predict: open `predict.ipynb` and run the cells to load the saved model, generate the test outputs (`predictions.csv` and `predictions_case_ending.csv`), and write the reconstructed diacritized text to `diacritized_output.txt`.
